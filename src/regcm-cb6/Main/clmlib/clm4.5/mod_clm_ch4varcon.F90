  ! Note that this is the additional Q10 for methane production ABOVE the
  ! soil decomposition temperature relationship.
  ! Corresponds to a methanogenesis Q10 of 2 when SOM HR has Q10 of 1.5.
  ! (No assumption is made in CH4 code about SOM HR temperature relationship.)
  ! Note that this formulation should be improved by making anaerobic
  ! decomposition in general a stronger function of temperature, not just
  ! methane production.
