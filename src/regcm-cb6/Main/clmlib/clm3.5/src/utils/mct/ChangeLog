One-line Summary: import of MCT 2.2.1 with Cray changes.

Purpose of changes: First round of Cray mods

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: 
Changed Cray options for MCT build to include vector info

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: faster on X1

Code reviewed by: none

List all subroutines eliminated: none
        
List all subroutines added and what they do: 
GlobalToLocal::GlobalSegMapToIndexArr_  - convert an array of global index
values to local values.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:
configure, configure.ac - new Cray compile options (native MCT build)
mct/m_GlobalToLocal.F90 - use new subroutine in GlobalSegMapToLocalMatrix
mct/m_Rearranger.F90 - rewrite by Pat Worley.  New send/recv order and
AlltoAll option.
mpeu/m_FileResolve.F90 - add CPRCRAY for cross compiling
mpeu/Makefile - compile C code first, then F90
mpi-serial/collective.c and mpi.h - support MPI_ALLTOALLV and MPI_ALLTOALL
        
Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:
- what platforms/compilers:
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 
none

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:
- build-namelist command (or complete namelist):
- MSS location of output:

MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:
