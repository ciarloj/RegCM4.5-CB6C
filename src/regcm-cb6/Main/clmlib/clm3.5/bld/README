CLM build and configure directory and scripts. Scripts to help
you prepare to build CLM, actually build CLM and then help you
to run the model.

Important files/directories:

--------- Configure and build scripts

configure ---------------- Configure script -- creates Makefile and files needed to build CLM
  ----- configure --help - Configure help mode -- sends information on all configure options
Makefile.in -------------- Base Makefile for building CLM
config_clm_defaults.xml -- XML file of defaults for CLM
system_defaults.xml ------ XML file of system defaults
XML ---------------------- Directory of source code to read XML files

---------- Scripts to figure out dependencies between source files (used by Makefile)
mkDepends
mkSrcfiles
---------- Directory to put modified source files in
usr.src

---------- Scripts to configure, build and run on various platforms
run-ibm.csh
run-pc.csh

NOTE:  To use the run-scripts you HAVE to set the following:

o Project number for Batch script.
o Setting of clmroot to full path of the root to your clm directory.

NOTE2: On non-NCAR machines you will also have to do the following.

o Convert batch notation to the syntax for the specific machine you are using.
o Set INC_NETCDF and LIB_NETCDF to include and library path for NetCDF.
o Set CSMDATA to the path of where you place your input data.
o On non-supported platforms, you will also have to extend the configure and Makefile.in files.
