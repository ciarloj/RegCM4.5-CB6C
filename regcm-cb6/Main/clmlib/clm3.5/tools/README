CLM tools for analysis of CLM history files -- or for creation or
modification of CLM input files.
	
I.  General directory structure:

	interpinic ------- Interpolate initial datasets to a different resolution.
	mkgriddata ------- Create grid datasets.
	mksurfdata ------- Create surface datasets.
	newcprnc --------- Compare output history files.

II. Notes on the build system for each of the above tools:

    Each tool has the following files:

	README ------- Specific help for using the specific tool and help on specific files in that directory.
	Filepath ----- List of directories needed to build the tool (some files in ../src directories are required).
	Makefile ----- GNU Makefile to build the tool (these are almost identical between tools.
	Srcfiles ----- List of source files that are needed.
	misc.h ------- CPP preprocessor file required by some files.
	preproc.h ---- CPP preprocessor file required by some files.

    Tools also have files with the directory name followed by: namelist, runoptions, regional, or singlept
    these are sample namelists:

	<directory>.namelist ------ Namelist to create a global file.
	<directory>.regional ------ Namelist to create a regional file.
	<directory>.singlept ------ Namelist to create a single-point file.
	<directory>.runoptions ---- Command line options to use the given tool.

    NOTE: Be sure to change the path of the datasets references by these namelists to point to where you
    have untarred your datasets.

    To build:

	cd <directory>
        setenv INC_NETCDF <path-to-NetCDF-include-files>
        setenv LIB_NETCDF <path-to-NetCDF-library-files>
	gmake

    The process will create a file called "Depends" which has with the dependencies for the build of each file on other files.
