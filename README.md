# RegCM 4.5 - CB6C

RegCM v4.5 - Gas Phase Module CB6r2vC Configured to run as an option instead of CMBZ

## Usage

config and make as you would with your standard RegCM4 (https://www.ictp.it/research/esp/models/regcm4.aspx)

To use simply input CB6C instead of CBMZ as 'chemsimtype' in the 'chemparam' stanza of your namelist.

You can modify emission and boundary condition inputs in the files below, but you will need to run config and make again.

emissions: Main/chemlib/mod_che_ncio.F90

CHBC: PreProc/ICBC/mod_ch_icbc.F90 or (mod_ch_icbc_clim.F90)

## Changelog
version 1: reset emissions for NO, and CHBC for O3, NO, & NO2 back to starting conditions (as CBM-Z)
